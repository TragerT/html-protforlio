<h1>About Me</h1>
<!-- 
<p>Dear Hiring Manager,  </p>

<p>My resume will tell you my work history and skill set, however, it may not explicitly address my character, values, personality, and gift set around engaging people and my propensity for growth and development. I will elaborate more on both in this cover letter.</p>

<p>I just turned 30 January 24th, and have been diligently working for Marine Fasteners since March 2014. I’ve seen the company grow immensely and played crucial roles in that growth. I’ve been in different positions spanning from production to the office. Currently, I am the Assistant Operations Manager and have been told I have the opportunity to become the Operations Manager in a few years. I have learned how to build and maintain great relationships with customers, fellow employees, and management. I do this all while meticulously performing my job duties. After excelling in diverse positions and demands, I have acquired a plethora of experience which provided me with a unique skill set, perspective, and understanding. I’m grateful for these years and all it has built into me. However, over the last year the company has become increasingly corporatized and changing from what it has been. Now after a recent company announcement, I’m seeing it is time to look for a new ecosystem. This I do not say lightly. I’m in things for the long haul and would like to explore MORryde as that home.</p>

<p>These following bullet points highlight the feedback I have received from people, both inside and outside work, and will help expand on who I am and what I bring to the table.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dependable, grounded, self motivated, and upholding strong values and character.</li>
<li>Warm and engaging personality. Big heart for people and wanting them to succeed and live their best life.</li> 
<li>Believes in people and committed to helping them develop and grow.</li>
<li>An effective communicator that leads by example.</li> 
<li>An eye for improvement, optimization, and problem solving.</li>
<li>A lifestyle of personal growth.</li> 
<li>Positive outlook on life which positively influences others.</li> 
<li>Self-motivated, life long learner, and strong work ethic.</li> 
<li>Values driven and highly invested in cause.</li> 
<li>Does everything with excellence and a teachable spirit.</li>
<li>Detailed and thorough.</li> 
</ul>

<p>I am friends with Abe Penner and he has always spoken highly of working at MORryde over the years. In the past we had even talked about me pursuing MORryde and him thinking I would fit in well. Now hearing a definitive change of trajectory coming, I see it's time to start exploring.</p>

<p>I do not take switching companies lightly, I get invested, I’m loyal, and in things for the long hall. This is evident in my resume. I have always heard MORryde was a great place to work both from observation and direct word of mouth from employees. After researching MORryde more, it continues to stand out to me. MORryde was founded by Bob Moore, Sr. in 1966 and he set the standard of doing business with the utmost integrity, hard work, and can-do attitude. I can see those original standards carried out today. This is so pivotal to long term success because companies can lose what made them great, if they lose sight of who they are. ‘Above. Beyond. Always.’, the Golden Rule, “how we do business is just as important to us as how well we do in business.” and “What else can we do for you?” are all signs of holding to, and growing upon, this company’s DNA. I apply the wisdom encompassed in those statements in my own daily life. Living by these kinds of mantras impact every facet of one's life. Skills and jobs can be learned and done by many, but someone living out of strong character and with a goal of adding value to others, far exceeds any normal job requirements. Living by these standards is how I measure and determine success. </p>

<p>Production, Sales, Inventory Management, Operations and management highlight my work history. At the same time I know my integrity, work ethic, character, positive attitude, and hunger will drive me to excel in even areas of no past experience or opportunity also. I have potential that still hasn't been fully realized. I want to keep pushing myself to reach that full potential. I have always risen to the occasion when given new responsibilities and would like to explore what it would look like to bring all of who I am to the MORryde team. It would be great to meet and have the opportunity to unpack this and learn more about MORryde. Thank you for your time and consideration.</p> 

<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Tyler Bontrager</p>
